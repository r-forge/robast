The Description field is intended to be a (one paragraph) description of
what the package does and why it may be useful. Please add more details
about the package functionality and implemented methods in your
Description text.

If there are references describing the methods in your package, please
add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
or if those are not available: <https:...>
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for
auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in
quotes: "Title")

Please add \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explain
the functions results in the documentation. Please write about the
structure of the output (class) and also what the output means. (If a
function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.
\value{No return value, called for side effects} or similar)
  Missing Rd-tags:
      getInfGamma.Rd: \value
      inputGenerator.Rd: \value

\dontrun{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed
(e.g. because of missing additional software, missing API keys, ...) by
the user. That's why wrapping examples in \dontrun{} adds the comment
("# Not run:") as a warning for the user. Does not seem necessary.
Please replace \dontrun with \donttest.

Please unwrap the examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, or replace
dontrun{} with \donttest{}.

You still have the standardtexts in your .Rd-files. Please omit them
since they are not necessary.
e.g.: ~~ If necessary, more details than the __description__ above ~~
-> man/asAnscombe.Rd;  man/asL1.Rd; man/asL4.Rd

You are setting options(warn=-1) in your function. This is not allowed.
Please rather use suppressWarnings() if really needed.

Please fix and resubmit.

+ we revised the 'Description' field in the DESCRIPTION file and now
include references. 
+ in files getInfGamma.Rd and inputGenerator.Rd we now have a 
  value field; as it describes the return values of several methods/
  functions, this is more a verbal description than 
  a description of the actual return type (although this is also
  specified).
+ in our examples we had valid code with long runtimes (>5 sec) 
  which we had put into \dontrun; this code is now moved to 
  file 'examples_taking_longer.R' shipped out in folder 
  [inst/]scripts to this package and referred to in the
  example section 
+ we removed the standardtexts (in comments) in your .Rd-files
  man/asAnscombe.Rd;  man/asL1.Rd; man/asL4.Rd
+ we have removed all catches to warnings in our code
